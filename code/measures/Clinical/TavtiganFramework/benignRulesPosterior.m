function posterior = benignRulesPosterior(C, prior)
%% Computes the posterior values for the รง benign rules under 
%% Tavtigan's framework [1] for a candidate C (O_PVSt) and a prior.
% [1] Tavtigian, Sean V., et al. "Modeling the ACMG/AMP variant classification 
% guidelines as a Bayesian classification framework." Genetics in Medicine 
% 20.9 (2018): 1054-1060.
% Inputs:
% C: (numeric scalar) The constant O_PVSt in [1]. 
% prior: (numeric scalar in (0,1)) the proprtion of positives in the
%   reference population.
% original: (boolean, defualt false) set to true for using the original 
%   ACMG/AMP combing rules. Set to false if modified rules are to be used.
%
% Output:
% posterior: (numeric vector of length 1 (number of benign rules))
%   The posterior computed for each rule.

% fracs contains the exponents of C to be used to compute the positive likelihood 
% ratio (lr+) for a single line of supporting, moderate, strong and very strong 
% evidence towards benignity. For example, the the lr+ for a single line of 
% supporting evidence is C^(-2^-3). Note that the fracs for benign evidence is 
% negative of that for pathogenic evidence as given in
% 'pathogenicRulesPosterior' function. This allows cancelling pathogenic
% and benign evidence of equal strength. However, no ACMG/AMP rule
% explicitly combines them.
fracs = -[2^-3, 2^-2, 2^-1, 1]';

% The combined lr+ of a rule is obtained by multiplying the lr+ for evidences 
% supported in the rule. For example, for the rule requiring 2 strong 
% evidence, combined lr+ is C^(-2*2^-1).
% The posterior for the rule is computed from the prior and the combined lr+.
% The vector of counts below specify the number of evidence of each kind
% supported in the rule. For example, the rule supports
% and 2 strong evidence.
posterior(1) = locallrPlus2Posterior(C^(dotprod([0,0,2,0],fracs)), prior);
